# Location info for Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform datacenters.

"""
You can import and use this in other code like this:
  import cloud
This will define several variables with information about the current machine
where you are running this code. For example:
   cloud.ipaddr: "54.242.85.178"
  cloud.dnsname: "c2-54-242-85-178.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
 cloud.provider: "Amazon AWS/EC2 Cloud"
     cloud.zone: "s-west-1b"
   cloud.region: "s-west-1"
    cloud.title: "US West (N. California)"
     cloud.city: "Palo Alto"
   cloud.coords: (37.44, -122.14)   # this is a pair containing latitude, longitude

You can also run this file in standalone demo mode like this:
  python3 cloud.py
It will print out information about every known EC2 and GCE datacenter, along
with info about the cloud machine where you are running this code, if known.

# Amazon does not seem to publish information about the actual physical
# locations of their AWS EC2 datacenters at all, even though they sometimes use
# suggestive titles like "US East (N. Virginia)". 
#
# The actual street addresses for the data centers are not public, and the
# buildings themselves can be a little difficult to find (see [1] for example).
# Even finding the approximate city or county involves a little guesswork. As
# best I am able, I've compiled below the name of the nearest major city where
# each region's datacenters seem to be housed, and the geographic latitude,
# longitude coordinates for those locations.
#
# Some of the informabion below comes from Turnkey Linux [2]. Those folks are using
# this information as part of their project, but they don't seem to cite their
# sources for this information.
#
# Google is a bit more public about the actual physical locations of their GCP
# GCE datacenters than Amazon, but the location data below is still only an
# approximation.
#
# For both AWS and GCP, each "region" contains several "availability zones",
# each of which in turn contains several "data centers". The data centers are
# the physical buildings that house the enormous number of computers that make
# up Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, including Elastic Cloud
# Compute (EC2) and Google Compute Engine (GCE).
