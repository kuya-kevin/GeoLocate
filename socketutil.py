# socketutil.py module

"""
This module contains socket helpers designed to make regular Python sockets a
little easier to work with. By themselves, Python sockets are a little
cumbersome -- there is no way to read up to the first blank line, for example,
and most of the methods only work with bytes objects instead of string objects.
This class provides a wrapper for sockets that adds a few such new features.

Example usage:

    import socket
    import socketutil

    s = socketutil.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    addr = (host, port)
    s.connect(addr)
    s.sendall("Hello\n")                  # Encodes the string then sends it.
    request = s.recv_until("\r\n\r\n")    # This reads everything up to the first blank line
    n = ...
    body = s.recv_exactly(n)              # This reads exactly n bytes, no more, no less
    s.close()
"""
