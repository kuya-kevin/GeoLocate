# This is a fabric2 configuration file for deploying and running code in
# the cloud.
#
# To use this file, you need to have the `fab` command installed from the
# fabric3 package (see: https://pypi.org/project/Fabric3/). You can either:
#
# (a) Rely on the copy installed on all of our Google Cloud and Amazon
#     Cloud servers. Copy your code to any cloud machine by either loging in and
#     running `git clone` and/or `git pull` and `git update`, or transfer your
#     code using `scp` directly from your own laptop. Then log in to the cloud
#     machine using ssh and run the `fab` commands from there.
# (b) Or, install Fabric3 on your own computer and run the `fab` commands from
#     your own local terminal.
#
# To deploy code to all cloud hosts, run this command:
#    fab -P deploy
# To run the code on all cloud hosts, run this command on radius:
#    fab -P start
# To do both, run this command on radius:
#    fab -P deploy start
#
# You can edit this file however you like, but update the instructions above if
# you do so that it is clear how to deploy and start your geoanalyze service.

# ~/.ssh/id_rsa instead.
